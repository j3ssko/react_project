## Social Card - Simple React App

[Live Demo](https://j3ssko.github.io/react_project/)

This was my first time setting up a React app from scratch. I wanted to get an idea of the structure and organization of the code so I didn't do anything complicated. The code is all contained within the index file and has a few simple components.

## Development

React, JSX, HTML.
